This will load all the files that are necessary for the mesh reconstruction.
These must be saved in the folder that is indicated in 'Input folders where all MRI images are stored'
- note this should not be the path to the specific patient folder but rather the folder that contains 
all of the patient data, the patient ID and scan time provided will then link to the specific folder.

When running this a directory will be created (in the relevant patient folder) called
'patientIDscantime_results_Early_diastole' or 'patientIDscantime_results_End_diastole'.
This is however only the case if the directory does not already exist, if it does it will
not be overwritten.

Before running this (as well as setting patient ID, Scan time and Diastole time), the boxes underneath
must also be filled out.

1) No of images - the number of images taken over one heart beat (this must be either 20 or 25).

2) First SA slice - this is the uppermost SA bound that will be used in the mesh reconstruction.
even though most patients first SA slice is 0 this may not always be the first slice to be used.

3) Last SA slice - this is always the final SA slice for which data exists.

4) End diastole/End systole/Early diastole image - which of the MRI images corresponds to which of these 
times, generally this must be observed by examining the images over a full period and making a suitable
determination.

5) If any of the information in these boxes is changed then Load data MUST BE RUN AGAIN. This is to ensure
that the subsequent programmes use the correct data.
