This process is almost identical to the SA boundary segmentation but this time there are always
3 LA images to work through.

User must manually select which slice to work on, 

1) draw a rectangular box to define the region of interest (double click inside the box when this is done)

2) user can then start defining the endocardial boundary (using a greater concentration of points around
any turns to avoid the boundary being too sharp at these points). 
BEFORE PLACING THE LAST POINT click on 'stop', then place the final point and click on re-plot.
After this is clicked, user is free to move boundary points around to fine tune boundary definition.
When the boundary definition is complete (making sure the figure is active) push the space key, 
this will draw the previously defined boundary over top of the image and allow the user to move on 
to the epicardial boundary.

3) epicardial boundary process is carried out the same as above, however now when pushing the space key 
it will return to the list of SA slices and allow the user to click on the next slice and complete
this process again.

4) carry out this above process for all 3 LA images

5) all SA boundary pictures are saved in the results folder which was created in the previous step.
