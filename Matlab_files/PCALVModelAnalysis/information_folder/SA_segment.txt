This step involves carrying out short axis segmentations for all of the slices indicated above
(from First SA slice to Last SA slice).

User must manually select which slice to work on, 

1) draw a rectangular box to define the region of interest (double click inside the box when this is done)

2) user can then start defining the endocardial boundary using between 8-10 points. 
BEFORE PLACING THE LAST POINT click on 'stop', then place the final point and click on re-plot.
After this is clicked, user is free to move boundary points around to fine tune boundary definition.
When the boundary definition is complete (making sure the figure is active) push the space key, 
this will draw the previously defined boundary and allow the user to move on to the epicardial boundary.

3) epicardial boundary process is carried out the same as above, now when pushing the space key 
it will return to the list of SA slices and allow the user to click on the next slice and complete
this process again.

4) carry out this above process for all of the required SA images

5) all SA boundary pictures are saved in the results folder which was created in the previous step.
