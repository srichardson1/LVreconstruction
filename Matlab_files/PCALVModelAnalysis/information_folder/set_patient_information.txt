The boxes below should be filled with the appropriate information for the patient under investigation.

patient id, scan time (baseline or follow up) and diastole time must all be set.

End Diastole image, End systole image and Early diastole image are all set between 1 and the No. of images
(which is generally 25 but can be 20). This information is obtained by watching through a heartbeat 
and ascertaining which image corresponds to which of these images (Note that End diastole generally
corresponds to image no 1)

First SA slice is often set to SA0 but depending on the quality of these images it may be 
necessary to start construction further down the left ventricle. As such it is possible to
set which of the SA slices is the base.

Last SA slice is the short axis slice that has been taken closest to the apex. (this can vary
quite widely)
