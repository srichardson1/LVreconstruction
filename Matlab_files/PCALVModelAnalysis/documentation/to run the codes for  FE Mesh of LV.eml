Dear Xiaoyu,

Quick answers:
1. are these from DenseView directly or did you have to pick/click the MRI =
images to get these?=20
    At this moment, I have to click the MRI image to get these. I suggest  =
Dr. Wen to add this function into DENSEview, but he does not seem to have t=
ime to take care of this. Maybe you can push him.

2. So we only use 10 .....
In the present code, you can use upto 2000 points per slice, and uptp 40 sl=
ices. There is an input file to tell the program of these information

3. Are these the only input information.....
Yes, if you only need the FEM mesh. Since we do not have the apex point, th=
ese is an input file to manually set the apex points (inner and outer). Als=
o, there are two input files to shift and rotate the image. All input files=
 are in the folder 'InputFiles'

Dear Yi,

Many thanks.  Just to check with you, the files in the /InputFiles folder, =
are these from DenseView directly or
did you have to pick/click the MRI images to get these?   So we only use 10=
 points around each slice, and 10 slices each
surface (inner and outer)?  Are these the only input information we need fr=
om MRI?

Regards,
Xiaoyu
