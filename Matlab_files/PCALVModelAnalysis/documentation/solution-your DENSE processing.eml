Dear Xiaoyu,
        I think Dr. Wen maybe right about the wall thickness.=20
        And the method he told to get the out-of-slice displacement is exac=
tly the same as we did last year.
       Yi    =20

Dear Yi,

Here is Han's reply for your information:

Hi Colin,
To get "out of slice" displacement the protocol needs to be changed
slightly: the number of contrasts needs to be changed from 3 to 4, and
in DENSEView -> detailed parameters -> Z displacement =3D "Yes". That
should do it. The breathhold will be a few seconds longer. Regarding the
wall thickness, just keep in mind that the thickness of the tracked
pixels start at the R wave in diastole, and therefore thinner than
systolic thickness.

Cheers,

Han=
