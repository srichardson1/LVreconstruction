Dear Xiaoyu,

         I plot the DENSE material tracking point as given in the data file=
 ?????_dispvector.txt that you sent me last week. I will send the code to Y=
unfei in next email.

         I notice that the out-of-plan displacement vector is missing (=3De=
xactly zero). You can see this in the attached .avi file., as well as in th=
e powerpoint file. We had this problem last year, and resolved it. But I do=
 not remember exactly if it is due to DENSEview or the scanning parameters.=
 I suspect it is due to the scanning parameters, since I have impression th=
at the parameter setting for paitients will not give out-of-plan displaceme=
nt vector, because clinical doctors usually just scan 1 short-axis slice.=20

         Therefore, if you want to get 3-D displacement field, you  many wa=
nt to contact Dr. Wen about this issue.=20

         As in the first page of the attached powerpoint file, the LV wall =
depicted by the DENSE data points is much thinner than that shown in the an=
atomic image. This is why I wish DENSEview can output the contour point of =
epi/endocardial surfaces.

          Yi=
